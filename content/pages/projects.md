# My Projects

## Open Source Contributions

I believe in sharing knowledge and building tools that enable others to create. Here are some of my key open source projects:

### üéØ PyFlowGraph
**A highly interactive, node-based visual scripting editor**

- **Technology**: Python, PySide6
- **Features**: Dynamic node generation, batch and live execution modes, virtual environment management
- **Description**: Dynamically create and connect nodes whose logic is defined by embedded Python code. Pins are created automatically by parsing Python function signatures with type hints defining data types and colors.
- **Status**: Active Development
- **Repository**: [github.com/bhowiebkr/PyFlowGraph](https://github.com/bhowiebkr/PyFlowGraph)

### üî¨ laser-level-webcam
**Revolutionary precision measurement tool featured on Hackaday.com**

- **Technology**: Python, Computer Vision, Hardware Integration
- **Achievement**: Micron-level accuracy using affordable consumer electronics
- **Description**: Measures object height and surface flatness using a $15 webcam and laser level. Achieves professional-grade precision at a fraction of traditional equipment costs.
- **Recognition**: Featured on Hackaday.com for innovative approach to precision measurement
- **Applications**: CNC machine calibration, surface quality assessment, manufacturing QC
- **Repository**: [github.com/bhowiebkr/laser-level-webcam](https://github.com/bhowiebkr/laser-level-webcam)

### üîó python-node-editor
**GUI framework for visual Python programming**

- **Technology**: Python, Qt, Node-based architecture
- **Description**: Organize and work with reusable Python code in a dynamic network with intuitive GUI and modular approach
- **Features**: Visual programming interface, code reusability, modular workflow design
- **Use Cases**: VFX pipeline tools, automation workflows, rapid prototyping
- **Repository**: [github.com/bhowiebkr/python-node-editor](https://github.com/bhowiebkr/python-node-editor)

### üè≠ PrintNC Contributions
**Open-source high-performance CNC machine designs**

- **Project**: 100% free and open-source CNC machine platform
