# Welcome to My New Website!

After months of planning and development, I'm excited to launch my new personal website! This site represents a new chapter in how I share my development journey and connect with the community.

## Why a New Website?

While my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BryanHoward) is great for video content, I wanted a space for:

- **Extended tutorials** that dive deeper into topics
- **Project documentation** and detailed walkthroughs  
- **Code snippets** and quick references
- **Personal reflections** on development and learning

## The Technology Stack

This website is built with modern, reliable technologies:

### Pelican Static Site Generator
- **Python-powered**: Familiar technology for a Python developer
- **Markdown content**: Easy to write and maintain
- **Fast builds**: Static files mean fast loading times
- **Extensible**: Custom plugins for YouTube and GitHub integration

### GitHub Pages Hosting
- **Free hosting**: No monthly hosting costs
- **Automatic deployments**: Push to GitHub, site updates automatically
- **Custom domain**: `bryan-howard.ca` with free SSL
- **Global CDN**: Fast loading worldwide

### Modern Workflow
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Version control**: Full history of all changes
- **Local development**: Real-time preview while writing

## What's Coming

Over the next few weeks, you can expect:

- **Development tutorials** covering Python, web development, and tools
- **Project showcases** with detailed technical breakdowns
- **YouTube integration** displaying my latest videos
- **GitHub integration** showcasing recent projects and contributions
